The User is a software engineer that wants to develop an app called INAB.

INAB is a React.js budgeting app that helps users track expenses, set financial targets, and monitor their financial status with a secure login system. 

Features include expense tracking, financial target setting, graphical representation of financial status, expense categorization, adding, editing, and deleting financial data, and more. 

The app is built with React.js, React Router, React Bootstrap, Axios, Github Pages, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, Chart.js, and CSS. 

Future enhancements include reminders, financial institution integration, multiple currency support, goal-specific savings, machine learning-based insights, expense sharing, investment tracking, expense analytics, and more.

The features are not yet implemented.

The frontend code is hosted on Github and a action is performed on each push to the main branch. The action creates a build of the frontend and push it to the gh-pages branch, which will be hosted on Github Pages.

The authentication is performed by the Google Provider.

The database is a Firestore one with the rule: 
"rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /targets/{targetId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /values/{valueId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}"
