The User is a software engineer that wants to develop an app called INAB (I Need A Budget).

INAB is a React.js budgeting app that helps users track expenses, set financial targets, monitor their financial status and forecast based on estimated incoming costs and incomes entered manually by the User. 

The code is hosted in a public repo on Github.com: https://github.com/justabayet/INAB

And the github page link is: https://justabayet.github.io/INAB/

Features include expense tracking, financial target setting, graphical representation of financial status, expense categorization, compare forecast based on different estimated incoming costs and incomes. 

The app is built with React.js, React Router, React Bootstrap, Axios, Github Pages, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, Chart.js, and MUI. 

Future enhancements include reminders, financial institution integration, multiple currency support, machine learning-based insights, expense sharing, investment tracking, expense analytics, and more.

The features are not yet implemented.

The frontend code is hosted on Github and a action is performed on each push to the main branch. The action creates a build of the frontend and push it to the gh-pages branch, which is hosted on Github Pages.

The authentication is performed by the Google Provider.

The database is a Firestore one with the rule: 
"rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /expenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /targets/{targetId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /values/{valueId} {
      allow read, write, create, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}"
